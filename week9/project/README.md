####Video Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFMRlbzOSVw>
####Description:
My name is Rui Pereira, and I'm excited to present my final project submission for CS50P Introduction to Programming with Python. This project addresses my personal passion for canyoning by providing a comprehensive guide to various rivers, including associated weather conditions.

Project Overview
The project consists of a Python program, project.py, which leverages CSV files containing information about cities and rivers. Additionally, the program utilizes external APIs to fetch real-time weather data for the selected river locations.

Files:
- project.py: The main Python script orchestrating the canyoning river guide program.
- /csvs/cities.csv: Contains information about available cities.
- /csvs/aveiro_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Aveiro.
- /csvs/braga_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Braga.
- /csvs/leiria_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Leiria.
- /csvs/porto_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Porto.
- /csvs/viana_do_castelo_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Viana do Castelo.
- /csvs/vila_real_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Vila Real.
- /csvs/viseu_rivers.csv: Details about rivers in Viseu.

How to Use:
- Run the program using the command: `python project.py`.
- Choose a city by entering the corresponding number.
- Select a river from the displayed list, by entering the corresponding number.
- Decide whether to receive weather information (type 'Y' for Yes or type 'N' for No).
- View river details, including a link to a PDF guide and important weather information.
